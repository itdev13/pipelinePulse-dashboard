// Create or edit one note. Shared by the Notes page and the Deal Hub's note
// rail so the two can't drift apart in what they accept.
//
// Notes live on the CONTACT, not the deal — every GHL note endpoint is
// /contacts/{contactId}/notes/... — so creating one needs a person chosen. On a
// deal with several people that's the rep's call, not a guess we can make.
//
// Two GHL rules this UI has to respect:
//
//   • AT MOST TWO PINNED NOTES per contact. The third is rejected. The server
//     checks first and returns a readable message, but the count is shown here
//     too so the rep isn't surprised at save time.
//
//   • COLOUR IS A HEX STRING (#FFF or #FFAA00). A named colour or rgb() is
//     rejected, so this offers a fixed palette rather than a free text box.

// The palette now lives in utils/noteColour.js: the deal rail, the timeline
// and the notes tab all RENDER the colour, and four private copies of seven
// hex values is how one note ends up yellow in one list and grey in another.
// NOTE_COLOURS is that same list, and normaliseNoteColour is the allow-list
// those renderers use before putting the value in a style attribute.

// CHANGING a note's deal or company is switched off in the UI.
//
// GHL's note relations endpoint needs `notes.write`, which this app's OAuth
// token does not carry — confirmed by probing the live token, not inferred:
//
//   PUT /notes/{id}/relations → 401 "The token is not authorized for this scope."
//   GET /notes/{id}           → 401, needs notes.readonly
//
// So the pickers could be operated but never saved. Worse, the failing call
// used to mark the install reauth_required, which halted every sync for the
// location — that is fixed server-side (scopeOptional), but the write still
// cannot succeed, so offering the control is offering a dead end.
//
// The BACKEND IS UNCHANGED and still handles these relations: routes, the
// relation calls, and the dirty-state fix all remain. Only the two controls
// are hidden. Flip this to true once `notes.readonly` + `notes.write` are
// added to the marketplace app and each sub-account has re-consented.
//
// Note CREATION is deliberately unaffected: on the deal hub a new note is
// filed against the deal in scope via defaultOpportunityId, the server
// attaches it on create, and a failure there returns 201 with `relationError`
// so the note itself survives. That path is worth keeping even while it may
// fail — losing it would mean deal-hub notes stopped being filed at all.
