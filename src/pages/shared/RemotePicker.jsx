// A Select whose options come from a SERVER search, not a preloaded list.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The deal and company pickers on the note and task editors
// had `showSearch`, which looked right and wasn't: the options came from
// useLinkTargets, which fetches the first 200 records once. Typing filtered
// those 200 client-side, so on a location with more than that the rest were
// unreachable and nothing said so. Search that appears to cover the data but
// silently doesn't is worse than no search.
//
// Both /api/deals and /api/businesses already accept `q` and run it under RLS,
// so the fix is to ask the server. This is ContactPicker's pattern generalised
// rather than copied a third time — same debounce, same out-of-order guard,
// same "keep the chosen option visible" behaviour.
//
// THE THREE THINGS A REMOTE PICKER HAS TO GET RIGHT, and why each is here:
//
//   1. Debounce. One request per keystroke would be a request per keystroke.
//   2. An out-of-order guard. Responses do not arrive in the order they were
//      sent, so a slow early query can overwrite a fast later one and leave
//      the wrong results on screen. reqId fixes the winner.
//   3. Keep the selected option. antd renders the raw value when no option
//      matches it, so a search that no longer returns the current selection
//      makes the box show a bare id. `chosen` pins it.
