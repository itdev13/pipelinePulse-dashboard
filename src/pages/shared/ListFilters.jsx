// A rep opening Deals wants their own deals. Before this, all three tabs
// opened on the whole sub-account and a rep with 14 deals scrolled past 300 to
// find them — the filter existed in the API and had no control in the UI at
// all.
//
// The default is applied ONCE, on first mount, and the choice is then
// remembered per tab by useTabState (2-hour expiry, so a new session starts
// clean). That matters for a manager: they switch to "All owners" once and it
// stays, rather than fighting a default that reasserts itself on every visit.
//
// "Mine" IS a preselected row in the list, labelled.
//
// It was briefly a separate sentinel value resolved to an id at request time.
// That split one fact across two representations and they immediately
// disagreed — see the note on OwnerFilter. The signed-in user's own id is the
// value; "Mine" is what their row is called.
