// Associating a contact with a company, from EITHER side.
//
// Reported: "There is no way to associate a contact to a company. On either
// the company page or on the contact page."
//
// The data model was already right — contacts.business_id is the link
// (migration 056), the Businesses page lists its contacts by it, and a deal
// reaches a business only through it. Nothing in the app could SET it:
//
//   * The contact record's "Business" box is GHL's companyName — free text,
//     a label with no record behind it.
//   * The contact API never even returned business_id, so the UI could not
//     have shown the link let alone changed it.
//   * The company page listed contacts read-only.
//
// So a contact could show a company name while the business record said
// "No contacts linked", and neither page could reconcile them.
