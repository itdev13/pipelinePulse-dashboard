//
// Three rules, all of which were wrong or missing on the deal's "add person"
// flow:
//
//   1. SHOW SOMETHING BEFORE TYPING. The dropdown opened on "Start typing to
//      find a contact", a dead end for a rep who does not already know who is
//      in the CRM.
//   2. EXCLUDE PEOPLE ALREADY ON THE DEAL. A duplicate was offered, clicked,
//      and only then rejected with an error — making the reader do the
//      remembering.
//   3. CAP AT 11 (a primary plus ten). A product rule, tighter than GHL's own
//      25-contact association cap.
//
// Source-parsed: these components import antd and the API client, and the
// question is about the option-list rules, not the rendering.
