// Insights — the 24 signed-off insight cards, for THIS sub-account.
//
// ── WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each chart reads a pre-aggregated view (migration 135) through
// /api/insights/charts/:key. The route scopes every read to the session's own
// location, so switching sub-account switches the figures with no filter to
// set and no way to read another account's.
//
// The prototype this came from read Supabase from the browser with a
// service-role key and decoded a hardcoded brand inside each view. Neither
// survived the port: the key would be a standing grant over every table, and
// the brand decode meant a new sub-account silently returned nothing.
//
// ── WHAT IS NOT HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The 22 insights the tracker marks Blocked or Not started. They have no
// query, so there is nothing to draw and a placeholder card for each would be
// 22 rows of furniture. Cards that are live but have one missing PART keep
// the design's empty frame — see InsightCard's ghost block.
//
// ── THE HEADER, SHARED WITH EVERY OTHER TAB ───────────────────────────
//
// This used to be its own bare <h1> sitting straight on the page background,
// with a paragraph under it and plain-text group headings below — the one
// tab that did not look like the other eight, each of which uses Panel: an
// icon, a coloured title, a count, inside a bordered card. Rebuilt on the
// same component so Insights reads as part of the app rather than a page
// pasted into it.
//
// The group names ("Pipeline Leakage", "Scaling & Rep Performance", …) were
// also plain headings with no way to narrow the page to one section. They
// are now the panel's own filter, as a multi-select — defaulting to every
// group, so the page shows everything until someone deliberately narrows it.

  // "show everything" on return.
  //
  // undefined (not set yet) and [] (deliberately narrowed to nothing) are
  // different states — see `selected` below. Defaulting the STORED value to
  // "all" would make "clear every group" indistinguishable from "never
  // touched the filter", and the second visit would silently re-expand a
