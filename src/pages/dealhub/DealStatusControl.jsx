// The deal's status, as a control rather than a badge.
//
// Deal Hub showed status as a read-only pill, and only once the deal was
// already closed — so an open deal displayed nothing at all and the only way
// to close one was the full editor on the Deals tab. This is the control a
// sales manager actually reaches for.
//
// WHY A DIALOG AND NOT A BARE DROPDOWN. Closing a deal REQUIRES a reason, and
// the reason lands in a different GHL field per outcome (the server maps
// won -> meddic_10, lost -> meddic_9, abandoned -> meddic_11). A dropdown that
// committed on change would have to either save without the reason — the
// thing we are trying to prevent — or pop the question afterwards, which
// leaves a closed deal on screen while the manager is still being asked why.
// So the choice is staged: pick, explain, then commit as one action.
//
// Reopening (-> Open) has no reason and commits immediately; there is no
// outcome to explain.
