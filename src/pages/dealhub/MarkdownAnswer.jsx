// Renders model-generated prose as real markdown — headings, bold, bullet
// lists, tables — matching GHL's Ask AI (ai-frontend's MarkdownRenderer.vue,
// which uses the same two libraries for the same reason).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The answer prompt asks for plain prose, but the model
// reaches for **bold** and bullet lists regardless — the "which deal has more
// value" answer and the "how many exist" answer both did, unprompted. An
// earlier version hand-rolled a bold/italic-only parser for exactly the first
// case and then broke on the second, which needed real lists.
//
// WHY SANITIZED. This is MODEL output rendered as raw HTML. marked.parse()
// turns "<img onerror=alert(1)>" in a message the model quoted straight into
// a live handler if nothing stands between it and the DOM. DOMPurify is that
// step — the same pairing GHL's own renderer uses, not a substitute for it.
// Turn a run of "Label: value" lines into a real markdown list.
//
// The prompt asks for "- " on every list item, and the model mostly complies —
// but not for short breakdowns. A count split by status came back as four
// indented lines with no markers, which markdown renders as unmarked text:
// it looks like a list while the model is writing it and reads as loose lines
// to the rep.
//
// Rather than only asking harder, the renderer repairs the common shape. The
// bar is deliberately high, because wrongly converting prose into a list is
// worse than leaving it alone:
//   - at least two consecutive lines
//   - each "Label: value", with a short label and no sentence punctuation
//   - none already a list item, heading, quote or table row
// A paragraph that happens to contain a colon does not qualify; four lines of
// "Open: 8" do.
const LABEL_VALUE = /^\s{0,6}([A-Z][\w '&/-]{0,28}):\s+(\S.*)$/;

// A short bare line that is plainly an option, not prose: "SMS (native)",
// "WhatsApp QR", "iMessage".
//
// Starts with a LETTER, not specifically a capital. Requiring a capital broke
// on "iMessage" — a real sender name — which split the run in two and left
// the whole list unnumbered. Product names do not agree to be capitalised.
//
// Deliberately narrow otherwise: no sentence punctuation, at most four words.
// The risk is turning a real sentence into a list item, so anything with a
// full stop, a comma, or more words is left alone.
const BARE_OPTION = /^\s{0,6}([A-Za-z][\w()+&./-]*(?:\s+[\w()+&./-]+){0,3})\s*$/;
