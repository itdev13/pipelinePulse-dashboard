  // So it renders through RichBody (which sanitises, the single audited

          Row 2: (icon gutter) | preview spanning to the card's right edge
          Why not simply nest the chip next to the subject: it has to stay
          outside the expander <button> (a button inside a button is invalid
          HTML, and the inner click would also fire the expander). And why the
          preview is a grid child rather than living inside the expander with
          the subject: as a sibling of the subject inside one column, it was
          confined to that column's width, so the card read as a narrow text
          column with a chip beside it. On its own row it runs the full width
          and the chip belongs to the subject line alone.
          The expander is a transparent overlay across rows 1-2 of the text
          columns, so clicking anywhere on the text still toggles the email
          while the chip stays independently clickable. */}

            subject itself out of view.
