//
// apiClient's own 60s suits the rest of this file — those are ordinary reads
// and writes, and a minute is already generous for one. The two `ask` calls
// are not ordinary: each runs a tool loop of up to 6 sequential Claude calls
// (server: toolLoop.js MAX_ROUNDS, claudeClient.js timeout 120_000,
// maxRetries 2), so a long thread can legitimately pass a minute before the
// first byte comes back.
//
// At 60s the browser gave up on work the server had already finished and
// written — the rep saw "check your connection", retried, and got the answer
// the first attempt had produced. The network was never the problem.
//
// 180s covers the common slow case (3-4 rounds) without letting a genuinely
// stuck request hang indefinitely. It is deliberately NOT the server's own
// worst case: past three minutes a rep needs to be told something went wrong
// far more than they need to keep waiting.
