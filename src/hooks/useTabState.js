// State that survives leaving a tab and coming back.
//
// The shell renders tabs as `{activeTab === 'tasks' && <TasksTab/>}`, so
// switching away UNMOUNTS the component and every useState resets. A rep who
// filtered to "Due next 30 days", clicked a task through to its deal, and came
// back found the filter cleared and their place lost.
//
// The store is module-level rather than React state on purpose: it must outlive
// the component, and putting it in the shell would mean threading a prop for
// every filter on every page. Keyed by page, so two pages can both hold a `q`
// without colliding.
//
// Persisted, but with an EXPIRY.
//
// It was memory-only, which covered tab switches (the common case) but not a
// reload — and this app is an iframe inside GHL, where a reload is a routine
// thing rather than a rare one. A rep who filtered the deals list, opened a
// deal in the hub and hit refresh came back to a default list.
//
// Not plain localStorage though: coming back TOMORROW to yesterday's filter
// still applied, with no visible reason, is worse than a clean page. So the
// snapshot expires — long enough to survive a reload and a detour through
// another tab, short enough that a new session starts clean.

// added. A snapshot from an older build is then dropped rather than revived
// into code that no longer understands it.

// v2: the owner filter briefly stored a '__mine__' sentinel that the tabs
// resolved to a user id at request time. That sentinel is gone — the id IS the
// value now — but a snapshot written by the old build kept sending '__mine__'
// to the API, which matched no user and returned nothing. On screen: "Unknown
// owner" and an empty list, on an account with 2,406 contacts. The two-hour
// expiry would have cleared it eventually, which is no comfort to whoever hits
// it first.

// location's filters would look like a data leak even though the LIST is

// rather than threading a prop through every useTabState call site.

    // That key is written per sub-account, so after a rep had visited two, the
    // scan returned whichever Object.keys happened to list first. Switching
    // location then compared the new snapshot against the OLD id, decided it
    // matched, and kept the previous account's Insights AI history and Recents
    // on screen under the new account's name. It looked like a data leak. It
    // was a scan returning the wrong answer.
